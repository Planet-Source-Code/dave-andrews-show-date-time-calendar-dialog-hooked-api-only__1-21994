### Description

FINALLY A FUNCTION THAT EVERONE CAN USE - Microsoft should have thought of this.

<BR>

This is a DATE/TIME calendar dialog that is created using only native Windows API. (See ScreenShot) NO FORM NEEDED! It is used / called like any normal function.<HR>

EXAMPLE: MyText = ShowDate()<HR>

This will show the Date/Time Calendar and allow the user to select a date/time from a calendar / clock.<BR>

You can also supply a 'default' date for the calendar to start at.

<HR>

This is my first attempt at hooking with VB and researched all of the requirements online at the MSDN libraries.

Vote if you are so inclined. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions.

<HR>

*AMPM bug fixed *sorry*

<HR>

ENJOY
